description: An introduction to MaintainableCSS, an approach to writing modular, scalable and of course maintainable CSS.
---

*MaintainableCSS* is an approach to architecting and writing CSS that helps you and your team write modular, scalable and maintainable code.

In practical terms, this means that as a developer I want to create new features, or edit existing features without having to concern myself with overriding styles I don't want applied, or worse that the code I write causes regression elsewhere.

## There is nothing to download

*MaintainableCSS* is not something you can download. It's a set of principles, guides and conventions that help you write CSS for large or small scale websites.

## What does maintainable even mean?

Having maintainable code means that I can edit a module and its styles without worrying that I have negatively caused problems in other modules by accident. I want to be able to write code that provides peace of mind knowing that my code is encapsulated.

## What does scalable even mean?

This means, that as the CSS codebase increases in size, that maintaining code (see previous point) isn't any harder. If you have ever inherited a large CSS codebase, and been worried about editing existing styles, you can sympathise with this.

## What does modular even mean?

A module is a distinct, independent unit, that can be combined with other modules to form a more complex structure. In a living room, you can consider the TV, the sofa and the wall art to be modules, all coming together to create a useable room.

If you take one of the units away, the rest still works just fine. I don't need the TV to be able to sit on the sofa etc. In a website, the header, footer, product list, article etc can all be considered modules.

## Who is this for?

If you have ever experienced pain in maintaining CSS, this book can help you avoid common problems. Whether you're in a team of 1 or 100, I think you will find useful advice in this book. Even more so if your site is constantly evolving.

## How hard is this to learn?

I would say it's very easy to learn. You can read the entire book in under 20 minutes and apply the rules in minutes. Let me know if I am wrong though :).
